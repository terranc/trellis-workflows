# Continue Current Task

Resume work on the current task — pick up at the right phase/step in `.trellis/workflow.md`.

---

## Step 1: Load Current Context

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py
```

Confirms: current task, git state, recent commits.

## Step 2: Load the Phase Index

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase
```

Shows the Phase Index (Plan / Execute / Finish) with routing + skill mapping.

## Step 3: Decide Where You Are

`get_context.py` shows the active task's `status` field. Route by `status` + artifact presence. This command replaces the user needing to remember the Trellis flow; it does not itself approve implementation.

- `status=planning` + no `prd.md` → **1.1** (load `trellis-brainstorm`)
- `status=planning` + `prd.md` exists but `design.md` is missing → **1.1** (write the technical design)
- `status=planning` + `prd.md` and `design.md` exist → **1.4** (ask for review; only run `task.py start <task-dir> --allow-empty-context` after the user confirms)
- `status=in_progress` + implementation not started → **2.1** (implement directly in the main session; no sub-agents)
- `status=in_progress` + implementation done, not yet verified → **2.2** (project build / lint / test)
- `status=in_progress` + verification passed → **3.3** (optional spec update) → **3.4** (commit)
- `status=completed` (rare; usually archived immediately) → archive flow

Phase rules (full detail in `.trellis/workflow.md`):

1. Run steps **in order** within a phase — `[required]` steps must not be skipped
2. `[once]` steps are already done if the required output exists. `prd.md` and `design.md` are the required artifacts in Native AI mode; `implement.md` and JSONL manifests are intentionally absent.
3. You may go back to an earlier phase if discoveries require it

## Step 4: Load the Specific Step

Once you know which step to resume at:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.X> --platform opencode
```

Follow the loaded instructions. After each `[required]` step completes, move to the next.

## Reference

Full workflow and detailed phase steps live in `.trellis/workflow.md`. This command is only an entry point — the canonical guidance is there.
